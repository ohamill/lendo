# Lendo Code Challenge

## Frontend
The frontend code is located in the `lendo-frontend` directory.

## Backend
The backend code is located in the `lendo-backend` directory.

## Notes
The frontend and backend were initially developed in separate repositories. This was a mistake on my part, and did not adhere to the code challenge's specification that the code be developed in a mono-repo. I apologize for the mistake. The two repositories have been merged, and their git histories have been maintained, but if there are any issues, the original repositories can be found in this same GitHub account, called `lendo-frontend` and `lendo-backend`.
